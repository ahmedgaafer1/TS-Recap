# 📚 TypeScript Recap Tasks

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript tasks designed as a recap and practice on various TypeScript concepts such as:

- Type annotations
- Functions handling mixed types
- Abstract classes & inheritance
- Interfaces & classes with relationships
- Enums & utility functions

## 🚀 Project Structure

| File       | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task1.ts` | Basic type annotation with an array of strings and numbers.                                                                  |
| `task2.ts` | Function to process an array of numbers and/or strings, returning sum, concatenation, or sorted numbers.                     |
| `task3.ts` | Abstract class `Shape` with concrete classes `Rectangle` and `Circle`, each implementing an `area()` method.                 |
| `task4.ts` | Interface `IEmployee` and classes `Employee` and `Manager`, including methods for salary retrieval and employee data lookup. |
| `task5.ts` | Enum `WeekDays` with a utility function `isWeekend()` to check if a day is a weekend.                                        |

node task1.js
node task2.js
node task3.js
node task4.js
node task5.js
```
